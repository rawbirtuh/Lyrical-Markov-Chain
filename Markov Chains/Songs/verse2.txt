As we ran from the night
You held me when it felt right
All the lights went straight to your eyes
It's you and i who will hold out till the morning light
Sandy beach was making love as a tide 
moves in on us
Feels so good walking side by side, wanna 
be with you all my life
When we out in the moonlight looking up at the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you holding hands and making love
Can I take it to a morning
Where the fields are painted gold
And the trees are filled with memories
Of the feelings never told?
When the evening pulls the sun down,
And the day is almost through,
Oh, the whole world it is sleeping,
But my world is you
You're ever welcome with me any time you like
Let's drive to the country side, leave behind some green-eyed look-a-likes
So no one gets worried, no
So no one gets worried, no
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I'm thinking of you fondly
When I'm on the train
I really hate your poetry
You hate mine the same
I'm thinking of you fondly
When I'm on the train
I really hate your poetry
You hate mine the same
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
And out of your head, out of my head I sang
A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart
And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be
In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me, me
Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name
I carved our names into a tree
I walked on decomposing leaves
I skated on a frozen sea
It's real as far as I can see
For it begs the question
How did I ever find you?
Now you got me writing love songs
With a common refrain like this one here, baby
But it begs a question
How did I ever find you
Drifting gently through the gyre
Of the great Sargasso sea, Atlantic Ocean
Got me writing love songs
With a common refrain like this one here
For it begs the question
How did I ever find you
Drifting gently through the gyre
Of the great Sargasso sea, Atlantic Ocean
Now it's time for a handsome little bookend
Now it's time to tie up all the loose ends
Am I still a skeptic or did you make me a believer?
If you hesitate, you'll hear the click of the receiver
You should see there's a place I want to take you
When the train comes I will hold you
(When the train comes I will hold you)
Cause you blow my mind
There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you
There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will be looking for you (for your heart)
When the unknown will surround you (Take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
There's a place I want to take you (for your heart)
When the unknown will looking for you
When the unknown will surround you (take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?
How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath
When we dance in my living room
To that silly 90's R&B
When we have a drink or three
Always ends in a hazy shower scene
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh, yeah
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh
And I just don't know what to do, my head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired, of trying, ooh ooh ooh
And I just don't know what to do, my head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired, of trying, ooh ooh ooh
My life in an upturned boat
Marooned on a cliff
You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift
Girl, what a gift!
You tell me with your tongue
And your breath was in my lungs
And we float up through the rift
Remember walking a mile to your house
Aglow in the dark
I made a fumbling play for your heart
And the act struck a spark
You wore a charm on the chain that I stole
Especial for you
Love's such a delicate thing that we do
With nothing to prove
Which I never knew
So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
While our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender
If I lose my way and forget what I need
Just remind me now of what you give to me
If you hold my hand and take me where you go
I'll show you the side that no one knows
I'm taking you there
I'm taking you there
If scars are for the living
Then I could be forgiven
And everything you need
I could give you
If scars are for the living
Then I could be forgiven
And everything you have
I take too
The sun is gone
It fell into the fall
But I don't want it this way
Why can't you stay?
Lay with me, I'll lay with you
We'll do the things that lovers do
Put the stars in our eyes
For a second I saw you so clearly (clearly)
For a moment I knew you so dearly (dearly)
I looked into your eyes and into your mind
You were laughing like a statue come to life
Darling, hazel-eyed mountain song, my soul longs for you
Running, I wasn't gone for long, I've grown all for you
They say that things just cannot grow
Beneath the winter snow
Or so I have been told
They say were buried far
Just like a distant star
I simply cannot hold
I still believe in summer days
The seasons always change
And life will find a way
I'll be your harvester of light
And send it out tonight
So we can start again
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And the mountains said I could find you here
They whispered the snow and the leaves in my ear
I traced my finger along your trails
And your body was the map, I was lost in it
With your soft fingers between my claws
Like purity against resolve
I could tell then there we were formed from the clay
And came from the rocks for the Earth to display
Crawling out of life my fire is strong
Can it be, I can't go on
And I'm hurt now, don't turn your back
Your hand in mine
We'll reach the sign of plains above us
Your hand in mine
Unholy times of pain relentless
