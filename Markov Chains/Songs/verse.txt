As we walk into the night
You kissed me and it felt right
All the lights followed closely behind
It's you and I who will hold out till the morning light
Dreams of you all the time, feel so good,
I want to get that right
Just can't wait till tomorrow, 
come on baby let's shake it
In the morning when I wake
And the sun is coming through,
Oh, you fill my lungs with sweetness,
And you fill my head with you
Shall I write it in a letter?
Shall I try to get it down?
Oh, you fill my head with pieces
Of a song I can't get out
My brother where do you intend to go tonight?
I heard that you missed your connecting flight
To the blue ridge mountains, over near Tennessee
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own
I don't want your Wall Street
Don't got no degree
Written on the concrete
A-C-A-B
Couldn't really tell you
What I'm trying to find
Everyone's so boring
Makes me want to lose my mind
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang
Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how you wanted it to be
And over my head, out of her head she sang
I want to hold the hand inside you
I want to take a breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me, me
What a curious life we have found here tonight
There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
And when we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see
Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all
I don't know who's behind the wheel
Sometimes I feel like that I don't know the deal
But when I tell you how I feel
Believe me when I say
It's real
I don't believe everything happens for a reason
To us romantics out here, that amounts to high treason
I don't go in for your star-crossed lovers
In the heart of a skeptic
There's a question that still hovers near
And all your left handed kisses
Were just prelude to another
Prelude to your backhanded love song, baby
The point your song here misses
Is that if you really loved me
You'd risk more than a few 50 cent
Words in your backhanded love song
For it begs the question
How did I ever find you
Drifting gently through the gyre
Of the great Sargasso sea, Atlantic Ocean
The point your song here misses
You got me writing love songs
Is that you really love me
With a common refrain like this one here, baby
Is prelude to another of your backhanded love songs
Now it's time for a handsome little bookend
Now it's time to tie up all the loose ends
Am I still a skeptic or did you make me a believer?
If you hesitate, you'll hear the click of the receiver
You and me with our long hair on the gold wall
After midnight we could feel it all
I'd go anywhere you want to
On the bridge levitating cause we want to
When the unknown will surround you
(When the unknown will surround you)
There is no right time
There is no right time
There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you
There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will be looking for you (for your heart)
When the unknown will surround you (Take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
There's a place I want to take you (for your heart)
When the unknown will looking for you
When the unknown will surround you (take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me
Whispered something in your ear
It was a perverted thing to say
But I said it anyway
Made you smile and look away
When we laugh into the microphone and sing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
When we're laughing in the microphone and singing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
Been a while since I felt this way about someone
I'd really really like to know you, more
Oh oh, know you, more
Oh, your eyes, they sing a song to me
I'd really really like to move to it, oh, go, oh
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh ooh, yeah
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh, ooh
Well this is just a simple song
To say what you've done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
When you feel like an ocean being warmed by the sun
When I was just nine-years-old
I swear that I dreamt
Your face on a football field
And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest;
Apart from everything
But the heart in my chest
Well this would be a simple song
To say what you've done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
When you feel like an ocean being warmed by the sun
Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you
In the dead of night I'll meet you in my sleep
And in the morning light you'll wake up next to me
Like a dream come true I'll take you where I roam
Then follow you back home
Tell me you care
Tell me you care
Ohhhh, make love to me
One more time, before you go away
Why can't you stay?
Ohh, my love...Come home to me
Just for a while, I'll leave this piece of you
Why can't you stay?
There should be words
There should be words that explain the way
But I'm tongue tied and twisted
Where's those words...
Cradle me, I'll cradle you
I'll win your heart with a woop-a-woo
Pulling shapes just for your eyes
And with heart shaped bruises
And late night kisses, divine
When it flows from the fingers
And turns to stone
It shatters with the touch
Feel the air, breathe it in
Turn the corner, take the bend
Give or take the bend
It's a spiralling cork-screw path towards you
It's a sinking, twisted path from me to you
The subtle piano raindrops
The creaking of the buildings and their cellos
The wind was our violin
The sky was a symphonic mural of stars
Hiding behind perfectly placed clouds
Because everything is the way it is
And everything is perfect in their imperfections
And everything is placed the best
And it is now, and it is here
And tomorrow is another now
Waiting to happen
Wide-Eyed
People, lost in the haze, defeat their own lives, it seems
Aimless, wandering wide-eyed, I was bound to love again
What if I lose all sight and ambition?
What if my heart weakens my vision?
What if all I need is right in front of me?
This is my winter song to you
The storm is coming soon
It rolls in from the sea
My voice; a beacon in the night
My words will be your light
To carry you to me
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
I was lost in the lakes
And the shapes that your body makes
That your body makes
That your body makes, that your body makes
I was moving across your frozen veneer
The sky was dark but you were clear
Could you feel my footsteps?
And would you shatter, would you shatter? Would you?
They told me to be careful up there
Where the wind rose up there, in this rage through your hair
They told me to be careful up there
Where the wind rages through your hair
Pay the deadly price
Lift the fallen prize
Told you soon will die
Sin that sails alight
Carry ungodly crimes
Travelling out of reach
Taking the weight of the night upon my back
You cannot believe the pain that I've seen
Changing ways, events prolong
Hidden by the mist, insinuate what's gone
Insinuate what's gone...
Forced to watch not eagerly
Breaking hearts with words and all ecstasy
The ecstasy...
Your hand in mine
We'll reach the sign of plains above us
Your hand in mine
Unholy times of pain relentless
