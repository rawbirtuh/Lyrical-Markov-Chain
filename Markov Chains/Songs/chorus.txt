As we ran from the night
You held me when it felt right
All the lights went straight to your eyes
It's you and i who will hold out till the morning light
Sandy beach was making love as a tide 
moves in on us
Feels so good walking side by side, wanna 
be with you all my life
When we out in the moonlight looking up at the stars above
Feels so good when I'm near you holding hands and making love
Can I take it to a morning
Where the fields are painted gold
And the trees are filled with memories
Of the feelings never told?
When the evening pulls the sun down,
And the day is almost through,
Oh, the whole world it is sleeping,
But my world is you
You're ever welcome with me any time you like
Let's drive to the country side, leave behind some green-eyed look-a-likes
So no one gets worried, no
So no one gets worried, no
I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough
Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I'm thinking of you fondly
When I'm on the train
I really hate your poetry
You hate mine the same
I'm thinking of you fondly
When I'm on the train
I really hate your poetry
You hate mine the same
Breathe out, so I can breathe you in
Hold you in
And now I know you've always been
And out of your head, out of my head I sang
A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then its smiles cover your heart
And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be
In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me, me
Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
That made your voice so smooth and sweet
But now we keep where we don't know
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name
I carved our names into a tree
I walked on decomposing leaves
I skated on a frozen sea
It's real as far as I can see
For it begs the question
How did I ever find you?
Now you got me writing love songs
With a common refrain like this one here, baby
But it begs a question
How did I ever find you
Drifting gently through the gyre
Of the great Sargasso sea, Atlantic Ocean
Got me writing love songs
With a common refrain like this one here
For it begs the question
How did I ever find you
Drifting gently through the gyre
Of the great Sargasso sea, Atlantic Ocean
Now it's time for a handsome little bookend
Now it's time to tie up all the loose ends
Am I still a skeptic or did you make me a believer?
If you hesitate, you'll hear the click of the receiver
You should see there's a place I want to take you
When the train comes I will hold you
(When the train comes I will hold you)
Cause you blow my mind
There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you
There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will be looking for you (for your heart)
When the unknown will surround you (Take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
There's a place I want to take you (for your heart)
When the unknown will looking for you
When the unknown will surround you (take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
Lord, I no longer believe
Drowned in living waters
Cursed by the love that I received
From my brother's daughter
Like Hephaestion, who died
Alexander's lover
Now my riverbed has dried
Shall I find no other?
How much sorrow can I take?
Blackbird on my shoulder
And what difference does it make
When this love is over?
Shall I sleep within your bed
River of unhappiness
Hold your hands upon my head
Till I breathe my last breath
When we dance in my living room
To that silly 90's R&B
When we have a drink or three
Always ends in a hazy shower scene
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh, yeah
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh
And I just don't know what to do, my head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired, of trying, ooh ooh ooh
And I just don't know what to do, my head has such a cloudy view
I'm so tired, of trying, ooh ooh ooh
My life in an upturned boat
Marooned on a cliff
You brought me a great big flood
And you gave me a lift
Girl, what a gift!
You tell me with your tongue
And your breath was in my lungs
And we float up through the rift
Remember walking a mile to your house
Aglow in the dark
I made a fumbling play for your heart
And the act struck a spark
You wore a charm on the chain that I stole
Especial for you
Love's such a delicate thing that we do
With nothing to prove
Which I never knew
So stay there
'Cause I'll be coming over
While our blood's still young
It's so young, it runs
Won't stop 'til it's over
Won't stop to surrender
If I lose my way and forget what I need
Just remind me now of what you give to me
If you hold my hand and take me where you go
I'll show you the side that no one knows
I'm taking you there
I'm taking you there
If scars are for the living
Then I could be forgiven
And everything you need
I could give you
If scars are for the living
Then I could be forgiven
And everything you have
I take too
The sun is gone
It fell into the fall
But I don't want it this way
Why can't you stay?
Lay with me, I'll lay with you
We'll do the things that lovers do
Put the stars in our eyes
For a second I saw you so clearly (clearly)
For a moment I knew you so dearly (dearly)
I looked into your eyes and into your mind
You were laughing like a statue come to life
Darling, hazel-eyed mountain song, my soul longs for you
Running, I wasn't gone for long, I've grown all for you
They say that things just cannot grow
Beneath the winter snow
Or so I have been told
They say were buried far
Just like a distant star
I simply cannot hold
I still believe in summer days
The seasons always change
And life will find a way
I'll be your harvester of light
And send it out tonight
So we can start again
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you
So excuse me forgetting, but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
And the mountains said I could find you here
They whispered the snow and the leaves in my ear
I traced my finger along your trails
And your body was the map, I was lost in it
With your soft fingers between my claws
Like purity against resolve
I could tell then there we were formed from the clay
And came from the rocks for the Earth to display
Crawling out of life my fire is strong
Can it be, I can't go on
And I'm hurt now, don't turn your back
Your hand in mine
We'll reach the sign of plains above us
Your hand in mine
Unholy times of pain relentless
Maybe it's your kiss, and your touch
That makes me want you more than love
All the lights followed closely behind
It's you and I who will hold out till the morning light
After the moment with you
After the moment with you
Oooh baby, you're so baby, 
you're so baby, 
you're so baby
Can I be close to you?
Oh-oh-oh-ooh, ooh
Can I be close to you?
Ooh, ooh
But Sean don't get callous
I'm sure it'll be fine
I love you, I love you
Oh brother of mine
In the quivering forest
Where the shivering dog rests
I will do it, grandfather
Wilt to wood and end
And the river got frozen
And the hole got snowed in
And near the moon glow ride
Till the morning light
Terrible am I, child?
Even if you don't mind
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world?
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's bursting into life
So call me up tonight
If you need somewhere to get out of the light
These days I feel like I do nothing right
So come with me and we'll go down the line
If everything could ever feel this real forever
If anything could ever be this good again
The only thing I'll ever ask of you
You've got to promise not to stop when I say when
She sang
Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
It's real
The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
You will grow too quick
Then you will get over it
The branches of the trees
They will hang lower now
There's a place I want to take you
Were you high when they knocked on the door looking for you
Take my hand as our bodies lift up slowly
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The first time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
I'm running like a plover
Now I'm prone to misery
The birthmark on your shoulder reminds me
Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me
The last time that you touched me
Oh, will wonders ever cease?
Blessed be the mystery of love
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
As long as you're with me you'll be just fine
Nothing's gonna hurt you baby
Nothing's gonna take you from my side
And I will, I I ohh, ohh
And I will, oh, only for you
I know that things can really get rough when you go it alone
Don't go thinking you gotta be tough, and bleed like a stone
Could be there’s nothing else in our lives, so critical
As this little home
A moment, a love, a dream, a laugh
A kiss, a cry, our rights, our wrongs
A moment, a love, a dream, a laugh
A moment, a love, a dream, a laugh
Tell me you care
I'm taking you there
Tell me you care
(If scars are for the living, I could be forgiven)
I'm taking you there
(If scars are for the living, I could be forgiven)
Tell me you care
Don't run away, don't slip away my dear
Don't run away, don't slip away my dear
(Don't ruin this heart of mine)
So with toothpaste kisses and lines
I'll be yours and you'll be
Doin' things that lovers do
What else to do?
The roar of an action silences all the words
The cry of an accomplishment
Drowns the whimper of ten thousand words
And we live in our actions and our reactions
And we live in our actions and our reactions
I will do you no harm, I won't fly
I will do you no harm, I will try
I could die in your arms, I could die
I could die in your arms, I could die
Is love alive?
Is love alive?
Is love
As we walk into the night
You kissed me and it felt right
All the lights followed closely behind
It's you and I who will hold out till the morning light
Dreams of you all the time, feel so good,
I want to get that right
Just can't wait till tomorrow, 
come on baby let's shake it
In the morning when I wake
And the sun is coming through,
Oh, you fill my lungs with sweetness,
And you fill my head with you
Shall I write it in a letter?
Shall I try to get it down?
Oh, you fill my head with pieces
Of a song I can't get out
My brother where do you intend to go tonight?
I heard that you missed your connecting flight
To the blue ridge mountains, over near Tennessee
We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone
I need your grace
To remind me
To find my own
I don't want your Wall Street
Don't got no degree
Written on the concrete
A-C-A-B
Couldn't really tell you
What I'm trying to find
Everyone's so boring
Makes me want to lose my mind
Hello, I've waited here for you
Everlong
Tonight, I throw myself into
And out of the red
Out of her head, she sang
Come down, and waste away with me
Down with me
Slow how you wanted it to be
And over my head, out of her head she sang
I want to hold the hand inside you
I want to take a breath that's true
I look to you and I see nothing
I look to you to see the truth
You live your life, you go in shadows
You'll come apart and you'll go blind
Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me, me
What a curious life we have found here tonight
There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
And when we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see
Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all
I don't know who's behind the wheel
Sometimes I feel like that I don't know the deal
But when I tell you how I feel
Believe me when I say
It's real
I don't believe everything happens for a reason
To us romantics out here, that amounts to high treason
I don't go in for your star-crossed lovers
In the heart of a skeptic
There's a question that still hovers near
And all your left handed kisses
Were just prelude to another
Prelude to your backhanded love song, baby
The point your song here misses
Is that if you really loved me
You'd risk more than a few 50 cent
Words in your backhanded love song
For it begs the question
How did I ever find you
Drifting gently through the gyre
Of the great Sargasso sea, Atlantic Ocean
The point your song here misses
You got me writing love songs
Is that you really love me
With a common refrain like this one here, baby
Is prelude to another of your backhanded love songs
Now it's time for a handsome little bookend
Now it's time to tie up all the loose ends
Am I still a skeptic or did you make me a believer?
If you hesitate, you'll hear the click of the receiver
You and me with our long hair on the gold wall
After midnight we could feel it all
I'd go anywhere you want to
On the bridge levitating cause we want to
When the unknown will surround you
(When the unknown will surround you)
There is no right time
There is no right time
There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will surround you
There's a place I want to take you
When the unknown will be looking for you (for your heart)
When the unknown will surround you (Take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
There's a place I want to take you (for your heart)
When the unknown will looking for you
When the unknown will surround you (take my hand)
As our bodies lift up slowly
Oh, to see without my eyes
The first time that you kissed me
Boundless by the time I cried
I built your walls around me
White noise, what an awful sound
Fumbling by Rogue River
Feel my feet above the ground
Hand of God, deliver me
Whispered something in your ear
It was a perverted thing to say
But I said it anyway
Made you smile and look away
When we laugh into the microphone and sing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
When we're laughing in the microphone and singing
With our sunglasses on to our favorite songs
Been a while since I felt this way about someone
I'd really really like to know you, more
Oh oh, know you, more
Oh, your eyes, they sing a song to me
I'd really really like to move to it, oh, go, oh
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh ooh, yeah
All your lies are spinning round my head
And all, all this line of sorrow, ooh, yeah ooooh, ooh
Well this is just a simple song
To say what you've done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
When you feel like an ocean being warmed by the sun
When I was just nine-years-old
I swear that I dreamt
Your face on a football field
And a kiss that I kept
Under my vest;
Apart from everything
But the heart in my chest
Well this would be a simple song
To say what you've done
I told you about all those fears
And away they did run
You sure must be strong
When you feel like an ocean being warmed by the sun
Sweet disposition
Never too soon
Oh, reckless abandon
Like no one's watching you
In the dead of night I'll meet you in my sleep
And in the morning light you'll wake up next to me
Like a dream come true I'll take you where I roam
Then follow you back home
Tell me you care
Tell me you care
Ohhhh, make love to me
One more time, before you go away
Why can't you stay?
Ohh, my love...Come home to me
Just for a while, I'll leave this piece of you
Why can't you stay?
There should be words
There should be words that explain the way
But I'm tongue tied and twisted
Where's those words...
Cradle me, I'll cradle you
I'll win your heart with a woop-a-woo
Pulling shapes just for your eyes
And with heart shaped bruises
And late night kisses, divine
When it flows from the fingers
And turns to stone
It shatters with the touch
Feel the air, breathe it in
Turn the corner, take the bend
Give or take the bend
It's a spiralling cork-screw path towards you
It's a sinking, twisted path from me to you
The subtle piano raindrops
The creaking of the buildings and their cellos
The wind was our violin
The sky was a symphonic mural of stars
Hiding behind perfectly placed clouds
Because everything is the way it is
And everything is perfect in their imperfections
And everything is placed the best
And it is now, and it is here
And tomorrow is another now
Waiting to happen
Wide-Eyed
People, lost in the haze, defeat their own lives, it seems
Aimless, wandering wide-eyed, I was bound to love again
What if I lose all sight and ambition?
What if my heart weakens my vision?
What if all I need is right in front of me?
This is my winter song to you
The storm is coming soon
It rolls in from the sea
My voice; a beacon in the night
My words will be your light
To carry you to me
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
I was lost in the lakes
And the shapes that your body makes
That your body makes
That your body makes, that your body makes
I was moving across your frozen veneer
The sky was dark but you were clear
Could you feel my footsteps?
And would you shatter, would you shatter? Would you?
They told me to be careful up there
Where the wind rose up there, in this rage through your hair
They told me to be careful up there
Where the wind rages through your hair
Pay the deadly price
Lift the fallen prize
Told you soon will die
Sin that sails alight
Carry ungodly crimes
Travelling out of reach
Taking the weight of the night upon my back
You cannot believe the pain that I've seen
Changing ways, events prolong
Hidden by the mist, insinuate what's gone
Insinuate what's gone...
Forced to watch not eagerly
Breaking hearts with words and all ecstasy
The ecstasy...
Your hand in mine
We'll reach the sign of plains above us
Your hand in mine
Unholy times of pain relentless
This is my winter song
December never felt so wrong
Because you're not where you belong
Inside my arms
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
Floating over your rocky spine
The glaciers made you and now you're mine
Your hand in mine
We'll reach the sign of plains above us
Your hand in mine
Unholy times of pain relentless
Your hand in mine
Reveal all life, uphold all others
Your hand in mine
Are you alive, with flames of sadness
